# Little Blog Project to Learn React Basics

I had a lot of fun along the way of my first React application.

## Try It

Get the node-modules + dependencies.
##### `npm install`




Get json-server to store the blogs as a JSON.
##### `npm install -g json-server`




Start the server.
#### `json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000`




### What I Learned

- **Custom Hooks: How to encapsulate component logic and state management.**
- **Props: Passing data between components**
- **Routing: Using React Router for navigating between pages.**
- **Fetching Data: Making HTTP requests to the JSON Server.**
- **Error Handling: Managing fetch errors with try-catch and AbortController.**
- **Forms: Submitting data through forms and handling form state.**

Enjoy!
